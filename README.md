## Planning & Wireframes

### The follwing [user stories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jablan08/LingoConnect_frontend/josh/src/components/resources/LC_user_stories.png) were considered when developing LingoConnect.


### Wireframes
View our [wireframes](https://sketch.cloud/s/7AboP) here!
The goal was a simple design with an emphasis on functionality. The user should come to the page just with the intention of translating a word or phrase. 


## Future development
* A feature to be added is speak-to-text capability


## Unsolved problems

* Refresh on user account page does not allow user to edit account. User has to return back to home page and then return back to account page to edit account information.
